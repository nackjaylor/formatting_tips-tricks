# Presentation Tips
Often you'll be asked to give a presentation to the class, and often this is on topics that might not be your favourite thing in the world. Here we will discuss some good practice on preparing your slides, practicing and presenting them to an audience. 

A fantastic guide to preparing a presentation comes in the form of [Patrick Winston's How to Speak lecture at MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY), which we direct you to as a supplementary resource (and really, a must watch).

### Note: these are to come in preparation for 2023 S1... stay tuned...

## Preparing Slides
As a first pass, make a plan as to what you want to present, the order you want to present it in and why you want to present certain aspects. This will allow you to put together the slides in a way that is not sequential, but thematic or topical. A presentation does not need to be sequential, but it needs to be clear, logical and engaging. Preparing what you intend to cover thematically beforehand ensures you have a lean set of ideas.

A presentation is not a report, and so your slides should ideally be there to support your spoken content rather than being your spoken content. For this reason, your slides should be *very* minimalistic. You can have dot points, but full sentences (unless they are quotes) are unnecessary. Why you may ask? Well, if someone is reading a slide, they are not listening to your presentation. "But how will I know what to say?" - there are two answers: know your presentation well enough that you fill in the blanks, and use speakers notes to jog your memory. The best presenters often have presentations which contain no words at all on their slides.

A presentation is a visual media: you should use as many figures, pictures and visualisations as you can. They are much more engaging, and allow the seeing part of your brain to work at the same time as the understanding part of your brain (which allows the audience to continue listening). These should be well sized on your material and be referred to as you speak. You should move to point to things and direct the audiences attention to exactly what in your slides they should be paying attention to and understanding. Slides like these should have you almost give a guided tour to why they're there, what they are showing and how it relates to the rest of the presentation. As you are preparing your slides, you should keep this in mind - it is part of the why you want to present it.

Slides should not be jam packed full of content, but they should contain distinct ideas. This does not mean you should have 100's of slides for each idea you have, you should prepare each slide with an overarching idea which you deal with sub-ideas on. Try to spend at least 50s to 1min on each slide. This gives the audience enough time to ingest the slide, comprehend the idea with your material and then be ready to move to the next one.

Less is more. Keep that in your mind. It's the best rule of thumb when preparing your slides, you can fill in the gaps with you speech.
